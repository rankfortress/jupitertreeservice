	<h1>Jupiter Tree and Stump </h1>
	<p>
	Jupiter Tree and Stump is a team of arborists dedicated to getting you the very best from your trees. Trees bring us shade and oxygen, they keep us cool and they bind the soil itself together to prevent erosion but in addition to their practical side there is a very emotional dimension to trees. People love trees and you don’t have to be an actual tree hugger to get a very serious sense of satisfaction from looking out the window of your property and seeing these majestic and beautiful living things.
	
	If those trees are part of your family then you can see us as their family doctor. We plant new trees and advise on which types will do best, we care for trees throughout their life including pruning to encourage growth, trimming to make them look their best and of course the necessary surgery to ensure they grow well, and that unsafe growth doesn’t threaten property, utility lines, or passers by. Then at the end of their life we take care of safe tree removal and grind out those stumps to leave no trace at all, or prepare the spot for another tree to be planted so the whole cycle can start again. We love our job and we conduct our work with professionalism and passion. Quite simply we believe we are the most responsive, most capable arborists you can call on in Jupiter, Florida. So if you’ve got trees, you need to make a note of our number.
